# Loan-prediction-using-logistic-regression
Loan prediction using logistic regression is a statistical method used to predict whether an individual will be approved or rejected for a loan based on various factors such as income, credit score, employment status, loan amount, and other relevant factors. Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning technique that is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, loan approval) and one or more independent variables (such as income, credit score, and employment status).

To make a loan prediction using logistic regression, the first step is to collect data on loan applicants and identify the independent variables that could impact loan approval. For example, if a lender wants to predict loan approval for a particular borrower, they might collect data on the borrower's income, credit score, employment status, loan amount, and other relevant factors.
